collapsed
fell
felt utterly powerless
was careless
laughed at the enemy's strength
was shocked at what happened
sought more strength
regretted a mistake
was ambushed by the enemy
was surrounded by enemies
was amused by how it all ended
vowed revenge
fell with grace
fought with every ounce of strength
vowed vengeance
felt despair at this cold world
held nothing back
gave it all
could not get up again
vowed to grow as a person
grimaced in anger
missed the chance of a lifetime
couldn't find a weakpoint
was overwhelmed
was totally outmatched
was distracted by a flower
hesitated to land the killing blow
was attacked from behind
fell to the ground
couldn't even get a hit in
was too damn lazy
underestimated the enemy
faced away from the enemy
learned to fear the enemy
was overcome by fear
couldn't perform as well as usual
wasn't in top form
failed to go all-out
tried taking on a powerful foe
took it to the limit
was backed into a corner
fought bravely
fought a brave battle
challenged the enemy foolishly
fought valiantly
lost the battle
died an honorable death
learned a valuable lesson
felt life slip away
enjoyed a tough battle
never stopped smiling
felt the hand of fate
applied all combat intel
was trapped on the defensive
had the tables turned
almost won
admired the enemy's strength
hit a wall
couldn't help but smile
cried and cried
lost all courage
stopped trying to think
suffered a double KO
fell along with the enemy
regretted nothing
didn't give up until the very end
gave in to doubt
wasn't fast enough
died
got killed
became a beautiful memory
became the wind
died peacefully
saw a bitter enemy
saw a pathetic lump of metal
saw conquering invaders
saw the enemy take over Earth
saw emotionless machines
saw a machine imitating a human
saw a machine ponder life and death
saw a machine wandering around
saw solder protecting their land
saw machines enjoying a parade
saw a machine dancing like mad
saw machines that believed in the uncertain
saw a machine in deep thought
saw a caring machine
saw a machine full of love
saw a machine flying around
saw a machine end it all
saw a machine living for combat
saw a machine eating its own kind
saw a machine in love with humans
saw a lost machine
saw a machine buried in sand
saw a machine behind a tree
saw a machine with dreams
saw a machine living in junk
saw a machine taking a walk
saw a machine cover the skies
heard the footsteps of machines
heard the screams of crazed machines
thought of many friends
wished for a friend's victory
thought of a loved one
saw a vision of those lost
saw something strange yet nostalgic
saw a blue bird
saw a white book
saw a black book
saw a white flower
saw swaying flora
heard the sound of flowing water
heard the sound of waves
heard the call of friends
felt the coldness of water
felt the heat of sand
saw old companions
saw a YoRHa once considered a friend
saw an android with red eyes
saw red eyes gazing down
saw squadmates lose their minds
heard the screams of crazed androids
heard a girl laughing merrily
