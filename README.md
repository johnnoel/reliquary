# Reliquary message system

[reliquary.johnnoel.uk](https://reliquary.johnnoel.uk/)

Inspired by the NieR Automata Reliquary System whereby upon the player's defeat, a "body" is left along with a message composed of three different parts chosen from lists of fixed phrases.

Here each message is only assignable to a single person which is managed by logging in via Twitter.
