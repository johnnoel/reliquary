in a cradle in the sky
at the Bunker, looking at Earth
at YoRHa HQ
at a city drowned in green
at the ruins of civilization
at a city consumed by nature
in a deserted land
at a city with a gaping hole
in a city reclaimed by nature
at a mountain of metal
at the capital of junk
at a religious mountain
at the home of scrap-iron
in a vain forest
in a deep, dark forest
in a lush forest
at the kingdom of machines
in a world of ended dreams
in a land of distorted fairy tales
at a city filled with light
at a closed theater
at an empty theater
at a sunken city
at a city consumed by water
at a city drenched in blue
at a fake city
at a manufactured city
at a city of boxes
at a city of building blocks
at an inorganic city
at a copied city
in a desert of shadows
in a world of sand
in days of sand
surrounded by the winds of death
in a dark hold beneath a city
underground
at the enemy's lair
inside an empty ship
at a tower built by the gods
on a tower smiled upon by angels
inside a tall tower
at a peace-loving village
at a village of refugees
in the free skies
below dark skies
at a battlefield on the sea
during the decisive battle
during a pointless battle
on green pastures
on a shining blue surface
on ground of steel
on a collapsed building
on dry sand
looking down on Earth
in the depths of hell
in the abyss
in the deepest darkness
at a blood-soaked battlefield
at a land stuck in the past
at a place of memories
in the land where he used to live
over there
there
at a garbage dump
in the boring countryside
somewhere very dull
at a place fit to die
somewhere very dark
in a confusing place
